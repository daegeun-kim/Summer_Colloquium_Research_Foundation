                <b>1. GIS Copilot</b><br>
                LLM directly into QGIS<br>
                <br>
                Natural-language to GIS operations: Users can ask questions like 
                “create 500-m buffers around subway stations and intersect with zoning areas” 
                and Copilot builds and runs the corresponding geoprocessing steps.<br>
                <br>
                valuated on 100+ spatial tasks: handles basic (single-tool), 
                intermediate (guided multi-step), and some advanced tasks. 
                Performs well for simpler workflows; advanced autonomy still evolving.<br>
                <br>
                Integrated plugin: Built as a QGIS plugin, 
                it supports both vector and raster analysis and links with external libraries like
                GeoPandas and Seaborn for extended analytics.

                CorrDiff: A diffusion-based generative AI model that downscales traditional 
                forecasts—from coarse (~25 km) to fine (~2 km) resolution—providing localized 
                weather predictions such as wind, precipitation, and temperature.<br>
                <br>
                cBottle ("Climate in a Bottle"): A generative foundation model capable of 
                simulating climate conditions at ~5 km resolution, compressing vast volumes of 
                climate data for efficient storage and inference.<br>
                <br>
                Earth2Studio & PhysicsNeMo: GPU-accelerated frameworks and inference microservices 
                built for model training, simulation, and custom deployment via the Earth-2 stack.<br>
                <br>
                Omniverse Blueprint for Earth-2 Weather Analytics: An open reference architecture 
                with modules like Earth-2 Command Center, Data Federation Mesh, and weather model 
                microservices, enabling interactive visualization pipelines and scalable simulation environments.

                <b>3. Felt AI</b><br>
                Cloud-native GIS platform designed to empower users to build maps, and spatial apps<br>
                <br>
                Automated Spatial UI Generation: Felt creates polished, responsive interfaces—buttons, 
                popups, workflows—based on prompts. No frontend coding needed. It takes care of styling,
                data layering, legend generation, and interaction logic—all inline with your map view.<br>
                <br>
                Data Integration & Scaling: Seamless connection to cloud sources:
                Postgres, Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, ESRI, WFS/STAC, and more.
                Felt also supports drag-and-drop upload of almost any spatial file
                type—automatically geocoding or parsing geometry without manual wrangling.<br>
                <br>
                Dashboard & App Builder: Within the same platform you can create dashboards,
                charts, histograms, and interactive apps, tied to real-time spatial data 
                updates—no separate infrastructure required.
