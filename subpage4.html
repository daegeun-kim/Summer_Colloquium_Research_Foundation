                <b>7. Situated Technology<br>
                What is your orientation to the CDP theme based on the readings, discussions, and references shared, or others you may incorporate.
                </b><br><br>
                My project engages the theme of Situated Technology by foregrounding the role of AI as a mediator in geospatial knowledge production. 
                Rather than treating AI as a neutral assistant, I see it as a situated agent whose outputs reflect the biases of its training data, 
                model architecture, and user prompts. By exploring locally run AI systems and curated datasets, I aim to question the dominance 
                of centralized data infrastructures and suggest alternatives that respect local contexts and user agency.<br><br><br><br>

                <b>8. Methods</b><br>
                <b>- Which software techniques, data practices, theoretical approaches, art styles, design tactics, conceptual acts, or material processes are emerging as pertinent to your practice?</b><br>
                <b>- Are you planning to use qualitative and/or quantitative methods?</b><br>
                <b>- What are the more important components of your project: physical, material, computational, written, aesthetic?</b><br><br>
                <li>Software Techniques: I am using GPT-based LLMs for natural language querying, paired with custom selection logic to choose appropriate datasets, ML models, and visualizations. Frontend visualizations are built using D3.js, while Python is used for backend spatial analysis using libraries like GeoPandas and Scikit-learn.</li>
                <li>Data Practices: The project relies on structured geospatial datasets, combining both curated local files and publicly available urban data. I'm exploring strategies to balance data locality (running analysis without cloud dependency) with flexibility and performance.</li>
                <li>Theoretical Approaches: I engage with critical data studies and STS perspectives to examine how AI mediates access to spatial knowledge, and whose perspectives are embedded or excluded in that mediation.</li>
                <li>Design Tactics: My focus is on minimal, functional interface design that foregrounds interpretability and interactivity. The visualization emphasizes semantic clarity over stylistic complexity.</li>
                <li>Methods: The project primarily uses quantitative methods (data analysis, clustering, modeling), with some qualitative framing around interpretation and user agency in AI-mediated mapping.</li>
                <li>Important Components: The most important components are computational (AI logic, spatial analysis), aesthetic (interactive web-based visualizations), and written (explanatory interface text and system descriptions). Physical or material elements are minimal and only included as necessary for documentation or presentation.</li><br><br><br>

                <b>9. Computational Design Experiments<br>
                <li>Include any images, visualizations, simulations, interactive demos, sketches, photos, models, diagrams, studies, physical experiments authored by you during the semester that are pertinent to your ongoing interests and project development.</li></b><br>

                <b>10. Visual Representation</b><br>
                <b>- What aesthetic modes are inspiring to you.</b><br>
                <b>- In CDP, aesthetics is understood as a means of sensory investigation.</b><br>
                <b>- Aesthetics is part of how you build an argument and how you communicate it.</b><br>
                <b>- What is your visual language and representational style?</b><br>
                <b>- A visual language can include physical and material qualities as well as screen and image based work.</b><br>
                <b>- Does your visual representation situate you in a specific community?</b><br><br>
                The UI of my tool will have significant influences on people's usage. I wish to have a simple, straightforward structure to the UI, 
                allowing and inducing users to ask relevant questions that the tool can provide. Further details will be constructed throughout 
                the development of the project.<br><br><br><br>

                <b>11. Rhetorical Argument</b><br>
                <b>- What do you want to say with this project. If design is an argument for something, what is your argument?</b><br><br>
                It is hard to have a defined question at the proposal stage, because usually the right questions emerge as the project gets closer to completion. However, the project argues that AI, particularly large language models, can fundamentally shift how people access, interpret, and interact with geospatial dataâ€”moving away from expert-driven, software-intensive workflows toward more intuitive, language-based, and personalized engagements with spatial knowledge.</li>
                This shift raises important questions about who gets to 'see' and understand the city, how data is selected and framed, and what role algorithmic mediation should play in shaping urban perception. By prototyping a query-to-visualization system, the project also argues for the potential of situated, local AI models as alternatives to centralized data infrastructuresâ€”supporting more transparent, customizable, and democratic tools for spatial exploration.</li><br><br><br><br>

                <b>12. Briefly outline of a potential capstone project based on the above research foundations.</b><br><br>
                There are a lot of things to learn, consider, and improve throughout the fall and spring semesters. The project will be involved in alignment of data, analysis tools, visualization tools, creating a clear interface and user experience for the query, and ultimately curating the dataset so that it functions as the type of tool I want, and addresses the issue of data bias.<br><br><br><br>

                <b>13. The Challenge</b><br>
                <b>- What challenges do you foresee in the development of this project? Are they challenges of learning specific technical skills, building relationships and finding collaborators, improving your visual design skills, finding or creating a dataset, etc.</b><br>
                <b>- Be honest with yourself and the audience about where your current skills sit in relation to your ambitions, and what your plan is moving forwards.</b><br><br>
                <li>There are several key challenges I anticipate in the development of this project. First, there is a significant technical learning curveâ€”particularly in areas such as building and integrating machine learning models, effectively manipulating large spatial datasets, and linking LLM-based query systems with local or server-based computational scripts. While I have a foundation in Python and geospatial analysis, connecting these components into a seamless, functioning system will require learning new frameworks and debugging more complex interactions than Iâ€™ve previously tackled.</li>
                <li>Another challenge lies in defining and refining the projectâ€™s scope. The modular structureâ€”where different datasets, models, and visualizations can be selected dynamicallyâ€”opens up vast combinatorial possibilities. It will take time and iteration to decide how flexible the tool should be, what types of queries it should support, and how much interpretive explanation the system should offer.</li>
                <li>There are also design-related challenges. While I have a sense for visual communication, I want to improve my data visualization skills, particularly through D3.js and interactive web-based design. Ensuring that visual outputs are both technically functional and meaningfully legible to non-expert users is a key goal.</li>
                <li>Finally, the project poses a conceptual challenge: balancing technical ambition with critical framing. I want to maintain space for reflection on AIâ€™s role in mediating spatial knowledge while also delivering a technically robust and usable tool.</li>
                <li>My plan moving forward is to treat the project as a layered learning processâ€”starting with a minimal, working prototype, then progressively integrating more complex ML logic and UI interactivity. Iâ€™ll also actively seek feedback from peers and faculty to help sharpen the conceptual clarity as the technical components evolve.</li><br><br><br><br>
